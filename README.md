## **Introduction to Pandas DataFrames - Replicating an article in Markdown** 

### **Files used to replicate the article**

- **Pandas.ipynb**
    - This Jupyter Notebook file is used to replicate the given article by using a combination of Markdown- and Code-cells. This file provides the basis for the HTML-file **Pandas.html**. It has the Image of **Pandas.webp** embedded.

- **Pandas.html**
    - **Pandas.html** is created from the Jupyter Notebook file **Pandas.ipynb** to provide the possibility of opening the replicated article in an webbased format, which is easier to access than an Jupyter Notebook. In the repository this file is saved inside the subfolder **dist**, together with a copy of **Pandas.webp**, which is needed to have access to the imbedded Image inside of the article.  

- **Pandas.webp**
    - Image used inside of the replicated article *Introduction to Pandas DataFrames* (PandasIntroduction.html). Is used inside the Jupyter Notebook **Pandas.ipynb** and the HTML-file **Pandas.html**, where the replicas of the article are created.
